Alkalinity is a measure of the buffering capacity of
water - its ability to resist sudden changes in pH.
pH is a measure of how acidic or basic water is. Alkalinity is the 
water’s capacity to resist changes in pH that would make the water more acidic.

This capacity is commonly known as “buffering capacity.” For example, if you
add the same weak acid solution to two vials of water - both with a pH of 7, 
but one with no buffering power (e.g. zero alkalinity) and the other with 
buffering power (e.g. an alkalinity of 50 mg/l) - the pH of the zero 
alkalinity water will immediately drop while the pH of the buffered water 
will change very little or not at all.
